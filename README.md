This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify tweets as disaster-related (1) or not (0). Leveraging the Kaggle Disaster Tweets dataset, we cleaned and preprocessed raw tweet text, then trained deep learning models—including BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and an ensemble model—to accurately detect real crisis events. The best model achieved an accuracy of 81%, helping improve emergency response by filtering relevant information faster.

Key Takeaways

Data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, embedding) significantly improved model performance.
BiLSTM and CNN-LSTM models captured both local and sequential patterns in text.
The ensemble model combining CNN and LSTM achieved the best accuracy and generalization.
Dropout and regularization effectively reduced overfitting.
Further improvement is possible using transformer-based models like BERT.
